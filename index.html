          <p>
            Medina is a focused and strategic scholar based in Brazzaville,
            Republic of the Congo, pursuing a Bachelor’s in Software Development
            through BYU-Pathway. He is currently enrolled in WDD 130 and CSE
            111, while also completing the “100 Days of Code” Python bootcamp by
            Dr. Angela Yu. With a strong foundation in mathematical modeling,
            statistics, and LaTeX typesetting, Medina creates elegant, bilingual
            academic documents that blend technical rigor with pedagogical
            clarity. His passion for structure and accessibility is evident in
            the way he formats exercises, integrates explanatory remarks, and
            designs educational materials. Fluent in French and English, he
            excels in bilingual academic writing and translation. Medina is also
            deeply engaged in researching tech career trends, diploma pathways,
            and remote work opportunities. His short-term goals include building
            a strong GitHub portfolio and applying for internships or freelance
            roles. Long-term, he aims to become a hybrid full stack and DevOps
            developer, integrating AI and automation to stay future-proof.
            Medina’s character is defined by precision, curiosity, and a drive
            to communicate complex ideas clearly. He thrives on step-by-step
            guidance and values both technical mastery and teaching
            excellence—qualities that position him for a meaningful, globally
            relevant career in tech.
